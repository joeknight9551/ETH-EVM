# The first FairLaunch standard on the EVM, inspired by the inscription.
In recent times, inscriptions have flooded the blockchain world.This trend originated from BTC and landed on the EVM chain. What is the inscription? The inscription is a transitional product of BTC that lacks smart contracts and the ability to issue coins. Some people may discover the string engraved by 'ordi' in the data: {"p":"brc-20","op":"mint","tick":"ordi","amt":"1000"}. What does this sentence represent? It represents the minting of 1000 tokens with the name 'ordi' following the "brc-20" standard.  
  
So, inscriptions are not something complex or advanced; on the contrary, they are a rather primitive compromise. However, what everyone cares about is not what inscriptions actually are, but the enjoyment and relative fairness of the process of inscribing.Inscriptions are not currency, nor are they NFTs; they are more like options, with the delivery time being when BTC smart contract L2 goes online.  
  
But, the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) supports smart contracts. So, if it's just for FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), why should we still participate in such a primitive game? Moreover, once all the inscriptions on the EVM are engraved, there is no market, no liquidity, and no market maker. The subsequent development all depends on fate, and many people will end up wasting their gas to exchange for a pile of worthless paper.

According to the first principles, I have identified the essence of inscriptions and understood why people appreciate them. Is there a better practice? Yes! We all know that Tokens are the ultimate form of inscriptions. Therefore, by combining the characteristics of inscriptions with ERC20 tokens, we can create a new way of token distribution. Similar to the process of engraving inscriptions, this approach allows us to achieve fairness and decentralization, just like inscriptions. Additionally, we can benefit from the well-established infrastructure on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and have valuable initial liquidity. This will be a great innovation!

##### Every 2500 inscribe, the contract will automatically add liquidity and destroy LP tokens. This process will be repeated a total of 5000 times.

###### Every mint operation automatically adds liquidity and burns LP, with no tokens held in reserve, so the contract is just a platform, and no one can control the amount of BNB and tokens. The tokens are initially non-transferable, and once the inscribe is complete, token transfers will be enabled.
